Feature: Worker Change Password

  As a Worker in the PeaceOfMinde Management System
  I would like to change the password of my account
  So I can have a different password

  Scenario: Change Password as a Worker (Normal Flow)

    Given the following workers exist:
      | user_name         | user_email                 | user_password       | new_password	 	 	| user_id   |
      | Andrews_A         | Andrews_A@gmail.com        | password123!        | brandnewpas$word		| 123		|
      | Cooper_B          | Cooper_B@gmail.com         | iwuhs@028904jOIjs02 | brandnewpas$word		| 130 		|
      | Jones_J           | Jones_J@gmail.com          | ijabnsiw@           | brandnewpas$word		| 445 		|
    When a request to change password is sent by worker with unique email "Cooper_B@gmail.com" and a new password "brandnewpas$word!"
    Then the Worker with user ID "130" has a new password in the database.


  Scenario:  Change Password with same password (Error Flows)
        
    Given the following users exist:
      | user_name         | user_email                 | user_password       | new_password  | message                    |
      | Andrews_A         | midway.lover@gmail.com     | password123!        | password123!  | Password is the same!      |
      | Cooper_B          | midway.lover@gmail.com     | iwuhs@028904jOIjs02 | password678!  | Password Updated           |
      | Jones_J           | punicWars                  | ijabnsiw@(92ns)     | 123           | Password too short         |
      | Jones_J           | punicWars@gmail.com        | 1                   | password678   | Incorrect password format  |
      |                   | proper.email@gmail.com     | 19972jISjj2oS1      | ooooo         | Username is required       |
      | Jones_J           |                            | ij1io91is@osla!     | passwerr      | Password Updated           |
      | properUsername    | proper.email@gmail.com     |                     | 2343          | Password Missing           |
    When a request to change password is sent by worker with unique email "Cooper_B@gmail.com" and the same password "password123!"
    Then the password is not updated
    And the error message "Your new password cannot be same as your new password." is issued to worker
